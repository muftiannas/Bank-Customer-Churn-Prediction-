# Bank Customer Churn Prediction	

Bank Beta's customers are leaving the company: little by little, their number is decreasing every month. Bank employees realized that it was cheaper to retain their loyal old customers than to attract new ones.
In this case, our task is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon or not. You have data regarding the past behavior of clients and their history of termination of contracts with the bank.
Build a model with the highest possible F1 score. In order to pass the review, you need a minimum F1 score of 0.59 for the test dataset. Check the F1 value for the test set.
Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it to the F1 score.
